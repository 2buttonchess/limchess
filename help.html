      <h3>Learning to play?</h3>
      <p>
      The game of chess is a fun and complicated adventure where 2 armies fight a
      grand battle to capture the opponent's king! Along the way, their soldiers
      will have to stand guard, fight other soldiers, or position themselves for a
      strategic strike.
      </p>

      If you're getting started with the game, we recommend using the buttons on
      the site to explore and try moving the pieces around. Once you've won or lost
      a game or two, you should have an idea of how the pieces move and what they
      can do. If you want to dive into the rules, you can check out
      <a href="https://www.chesskid.com/how-to-play-chess">Chess Kid's How to
         Play Chess</a>.

      <p>The important thing is to have fun!</p>

      <h3>Playing with 2 buttons</h3>
      <p>
      Using a keyboard? Try the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move around, and the
      <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> key to press a button or follow a
      link! See below for button descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
      Got a gamepad or other set of switches? The "left" control should toggle
      moves, and the "right" control should accept them (not yet implemented).
      When the game ends, "left" will start a new game as White, and "right" will
      start a new game as Black.
      </p>
      <p>All the page elements support focus and click events.</p>

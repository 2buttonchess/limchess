      <h3>Learning to play?</h3>
      <p>
      The game of chess is a fun and complicated adventure where 2 armies fight a
      grand battle to capture the opponent's king! Along the way, their soldiers
      will have to stand guard, fight other soldiers, or position themselves for a
      strategic strike.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you're getting started with the game, we recommend using the buttons on
      the site to explore and try moving the pieces around. Once you've won or lost
      a game or two, you should have an idea of how the pieces move and what they
      can do. If you want to dive into the rules, you can check out
      <a href="https://www.chesskid.com/how-to-play-chess">Chess Kid's How to
         Play Chess</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The important thing is to have fun!</p>

      <h3>Playing with Left/Right Arrow Keys</h3>
      <p>
      Using a keyboard? Try the <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key to move around, and the
      <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow key to press a button or follow a
      link! If you are focused on a slider (i.e. number of moves or difficulty), press the <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow key to 
      begin adjusting the slider. Then use the <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key to perform the adjustment (if you reach the 
      end of a slider and you press the <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key again, the value goes back to the minimum value). 
      Hit <kbd>Left</kbd> again to confirm you adjustment to the slider. See below for button descriptions.
      </p>

    <!--  <h3>Playing with Tab and Enter</h3>
      <p>
      Using a keyboard? Try the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move around, and the
      <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> key to press a button or follow a
      link! See below for button descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
      Got a gamepad or other set of switches? The "left" control should toggle
      moves, and the "right" control should accept them (not yet implemented).
      When the game ends, "left" will start a new game as White, and "right" will
      start a new game as Black. 
      </p> -->
      <p>All the page elements support focus and click events.</p>

      <h3>What is a Gamepad Device?</h3>
      <p>A Gamepad device is simply any sort of physical controller. This could be an
      old-school singular joystick, a PS4 or Xbox controller, controllers for wheelchairs such as <a href="https://bjliveat.com/bjoy-mice/240-BJOY-ring.html">
      a BJOY Ring</a> or <a href="https://www.atandme.com/?tag=wheelchair-joystick">
      the CJSM2</a>, or anything in between. Any device that has at least one joystick,
      can be used on the site. If a device has multiple joysticks, only one of
      them will be used.
      </p>

      <h3>Playing with a Gamepad Device</h3>
      <p>
      Using a Gamepad Device? The website has been built such that a single joystick can navigate 
      the entire webpage and the game can be played to its fullest extent! Simply plug in your Gamepad device
      to your computer and the site will display a message on all pages at the top that says,
      "Gamepad device has been connected!" when it is ready to use. You may have to press or move
      anything on your Gamepad for the site to initially recognize your device. 
      </p>
      <p>Push left or right on your
      joystick to navigate left and right through all selectable items on a given page. Push down to
      scoll the page down. Push up to click on a button or link. If you are on the "Number of Player Choices"
      or "Difficulty" slider, push up to begin adjusting the slider. After pushing up, push left and right
      to adjust the slider. Push up again to confirm your choice and go back to regular use of the Gamepad 
      device on the website.
